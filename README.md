# 🧠 Healthcare Diagnosis Prediction

## 📋 Project Overview
This project aims to **predict medical diagnoses** based on patient textual data using machine learning classifiers.  
We preprocess medical text, apply **TF-IDF vectorization**, handle **class imbalance** using **SMOTE**, and train multiple models including:
- 🌲 Random Forest  
- 👨‍👧‍👦 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- 🧮 Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this section, we explore the dataset to understand its structure, check for missing values, and visualize the distribution of medical conditions.

### ✅ Steps:
- Display basic info and statistics
- Visualize class distribution
- Analyze text data (e.g., word counts, frequent terms)
- Check for duplicates or null values

## 🎯 Objective
To build a reliable model that can classify medical conditions from text to support faster healthcare diagnosis and reduce human error.
